# DailyReward

This is a simple plugin, that was made to disptach commands, fast, reliable, and open source.
The original idea was to make something simple, that can be used as an addon for GUI.


```
commands: 
default reward: /reward
help command: /reward help
reload config: /reward reload
purge database: /reward purge <MySQL>
```

There are no known issues, I already recoded it and cleaned up the code. It is fully worrking and customizable.
